# httpie-timing
httpie plugin to add timings to the output

*NOT REALLY 100%*
SWIM AT YOUR OWN RISK

Adds timing statements to the output of httpie. Currently only supports output in custom headers.
The timing headers are added to both request and response headers. Not awesome, I know. but this
is a band-aid for now.
